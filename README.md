# Herdr Mods

Independent mods for [Herdr Desktop](https://herdr.dev/).

A collection of standalone mods—not a bundled workflow or replacement layout. Choose a mod below and install only that package.

## Available mods

| Mod | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [Better Changes](better-changes/README.md) | Git changes sidebar with tree/flat lists, stage/unstage controls, and a reusable inline or side-by-side diff tab. |

### Better Changes

## Quick install

Give your Herdr agent the install prompt for the mod you want. Each package's README covers its features and requirements; its `RECIPE.md` guides installation. Installing one package does not install the others.

### Install Better Changes

Copy this prompt into your Herdr agent:

> Read ~/.config/herdr-app/AGENTS.md, then add this mod: https://github.com/munza/herdr-mods/tree/main/better-changes

## Test

Run the development tests from the repository root with Node.js installed:

```sh
cd better-changes
node --test tests/*.test.cjs
```

The mod itself uses Herdr's native JavaScript runtime and Git, without Node.js at runtime.
